## Build Plugins

For more powerful integrations, Snowpack supports custom **build plugins**.  A build plugin is more than just a bash script: it's loaded via Node.js to customize and extend your Snowpack dev environment & build process. 

### Supported plugins

#### Official plugins
- [@snowpack/plugin-babel](https://github.com/pikapkg/create-snowpack-app/tree/master/packages/plugin-babel)

### Overview

A build plugin offers one of several different hooks into your application:

- `build()` - Automatically connects a build script to your build pipeline.
- `transform()` - Transform an already loaded resource before sending it to the browser.
- `bundle()` - Connect your favorite bundler for production.

[Check out our advanced plugin guide](/plugins) for more details and instructions for how to write your own.

### Plugin API

### Connect a Plugin

Connect a build plugin to Snowpack via the `"plugins"` array in your Snowpack config;

```js
// snowpack.config.json
{
  "plugins": ["@snowpack/plugin-babel"]
}
```

This is all you need to connect the plugin. If a build script is provided by the plugin, it will be automatically added to your "scripts" config. You can customize that script (and which files it will match) by defining the build script yourself. 

```js
// snowpack.config.json
// Optional: Define your own build script for "@snowpack/plugin-babel".
{
  "plugins": ["@snowpack/plugin-babel"],
  "scripts": {"build:js,jsx,mjs,cjs": "@snowpack/plugin-babel"}
}
```


### Plugin vs Script?

You can get pretty far with build scripts alone. If you just want to convert your source code to JavaScript/CSS and you have a CLI that can make that transformation for you, then a build script is probably fine. 

But, there are a few reasons you may want to use a build plugin instead of a normal build script:

**Speed:** Some CLIs may have a slower start-up time, which may become a problem as your site grows. Plugins can be faster across many files since they only need to be loaded & initialized once and not once for every file.

```js
"scripts": {
  // Speed: The Babel plugin is ~10x faster than using the Babel CLI directly
  "build:js,jsx": "@snowpack/plugin-babel",
}
```

**Lack of CLI:** Some frameworks, like Svelte, don't maintain dedicated CLIs. Snowpack Plugins allow you to tap into a tool's JS interface directly without building a whole new CLI interface.

```js
"scripts": {
  // Lack of CLI: There is no Svelte CLI. Our plugin taps directly into the Svelte compiler 
  "build:svelte": "@snowpack/plugin-svelte",
}
```

**Custom Control:** You can write your own project-specific plugins easily, and load them via relative path without ever needing to publish them.

```js
"scripts": {
  // Custom Behavior: Feel free to build your own!
  "build:vue": "./my-custom-vue-plugin.js",
}
```
