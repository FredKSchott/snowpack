## Overview

### What is Snowpack?

**Snowpack is a modern, lightweight toolchain for web application development.** Traditional dev bundlers like webpack or Parcel need to rebuild & rebundle entire chunks of your application every time you save a single file. This introduces lag between changing a file and seeing those changes reflected in the browser, sometimes as slow as several seconds.

Snowpack solves this problem by serving your application **unbundled in development.** Any time you change a file, Snowpack never rebuilds more than a single file. There's no bundling to speak of, just a few milliseconds of single-file rebuilding and then an instant update in the browser via HMR. We call this new approach **O(1) Build Tooling.** You can read more about it in our [Snowpack 2.0 Release Post.](/posts/2020-05-26-snowpack-2-0-release/) 

When you're ready to deploy your web application to users, you can add back a traditional bundler like Webpack or Parcel. With Snowpack you get bundled & optimized production performance without sacrificing dev speed by adding an unnecessary bundler,

### Browser Support

**Snowpack builds your site for both modern and legacy browsers. Even IE11 is supported.** You can control and customize this behavior with the ["browserlist" package.json property](https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/). 

The only requirement is that *during development* you use a [modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module). Any recent release of Firefox, Chrome, or Edge will do. This is required to support the modern, bundle-free ESM imports that load your application in the browser.
