- **Bug fixes, usability improvements & more!**

<br/>

Plus, we hit some VERY exciting project milestones last month:

- ‚ù§Ô∏è  **150** [open source contributors](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors) (and growing!)
- üèÜ **1000+** opened discussions, issues, and pull requests

<br/>

If you've been waiting for an ~~excuse~~ reason to give Snowpack a try, now is a great time to start! Try out a Create Snowpack App (CSA) template or install Snowpack into any existing project:

``` bash
# install with npm
npm install --save-dev snowpack

# install with yarn
yarn add --dev snowpack
```

## New: Redesigned Plugin API

Snowpack 2.7 ships with a new, streamlined plugin API for Snowpack plugins. Completely new use cases are unlocked with the redesigned `load()`, `transform()`, `run()` and `optimize()` plugin hooks.

Every hook is documented in our new [Plugins Guide](/plugins) for plugin authors. The new API is¬†heavily inspired by [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), so we hope it already feels familiar to many of you.

We've also redesigned the previous "build scripts" concept to use this new plugin system under the hood. `@snowpack/plugin-build-script` & `@snowpack/plugin-run-script` are two new utility plugins to connect any build tool CLI directly into Snowpack's build pipeline without the boilerplate of a custom plugin interface or the risk of getting blocked by a missing plugin feature.

Snowpack 2.7 is fully backwards compatible with older plugins, so you can upgrade without worrying about version mismatches. If you're a plugin author, check out our new dedicated "Plugins" documentation site to learn more.


## Import Aliasing & Improved Configuration

![snowpack screenshot](/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-2.png)

In previous versions of Snowpack, import aliasing were hard to understand and configure. Starting in Snowpack v2.7, [Import Aliases](/#import-aliases) get a new top-level config so that you can define as many custom aliases as you'd like. Package import aliases are also supported.

Import Aliasing is just one of many quality of life improvements shipping in this version of Snowpack. [Mounting directories](/#mount-options), [minifying output](/#build-options), and many common workflows are now easier to work with. Read the release notes for a full list of what's new.


## Multi-Page Application (MPA) Support

Whether you're building a Single-Page App (SPA) with JavaScript or a more traditional website with multiple HTML¬†files, Snowpack is the build tool that just works. In this release we've improved our bundling story to better support multi-page apps.

Starting in Snowpack v2.7, our Webpack plugin will look at all HTML files in your final built application and scan them for JavaScript entrypoints to bundle. This way your entire application is bundled automatically for you, without any complex bundler configuration required.

In addition, [@mxmul](https://github.com/mxmul) (Yelp) has been steadily improving the Webpack plugin with better default settings around optimization and performance. By following the latest guidance from Google, you now get a faster site by just updating a plugin.

## Svelte + TypeScript Support

Last week, [Svelte announced official support for TypeScript](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript). We're huge fans of both projects and couldn't pass up the chance to test the new support out in a brand new Svelte + TypeScript app template for Snowpack. 

Visit [Create Snowpack App](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/tree/master/packages/create-snowpack-app) for a list of all of our new app templates.

## Thank You, Contributors!

Snowpack wouldn't be possible without the [150+ contributors](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors) who contributed features, fixes, and documentation improvements. Thanks again for all of your help.
