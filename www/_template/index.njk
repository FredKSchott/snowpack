              <p>
                <strong>Snowpack is a lightning-fast frontend build tool, designed for the modern web.</strong> It is an alternative to heavier, more complex bundlers like webpack or Parcel in your development workflow. Snowpack leverages JavaScript's native module system (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">known as ESM</a>) to avoid unnecessary work and stay fast no matter how big your project grows.</p>
              <p>Once you try it, it's impossible to go back to anything else.</p>
