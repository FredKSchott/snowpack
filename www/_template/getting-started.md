Welcome to Snowpack! This guide shows you how to set up Snowpack from scratch in a Node.js project. Along the way you'll learn key concepts of Snowpack and unbundled development

In this guide you'll learn

- What makes Snowpack so fast? (hint: unbundled development!)
- What are JavaScript ES Modules (ESM)?
- Creating your first project
- Starting Snowpack's dev server
- Building your first project
- Customizing Snowpack with plugins

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: This guide will walk you through creating the Snowpack minimal app template from scratch. You can see the final result [here](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/master/create-snowpack-app/), along with more [examples](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/master/create-snowpack-app/cligit) to get you started.

Prerequisites: Snowpack is a command line tool installed from npm. This guide assumes a basic understanding of Node.js, npm, and how to run commands in the terminal.

Snowpack builds your site for both modern and legacy browsers, but during development you'll need to use a [modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module). Any recent release of Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Edge supports the modern, bundle-free ESM imports that load your application in the browser.

## Install Snowpack

In this step you'll create a new npm project and install Snowpack.

First create an empty directory. You can use any tool of your choice or the command line as shown here:

```bash
mkdir my-first-snowpack
cd my-first-snowpack
```

Now enable it as an npm project with the following command, which will create a package.json. Feel free to just hit enter for all the fields:

```bash
npm init
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: add the "--use-yarn" or "--use-pnpm" flag to use something other than npm

Now install Snowpack to your `dev dependencies` with this command:

```
npm install --save-dev snowpack
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Snowpack can also be installed globally via `npm install -g snowpack`. But, we recommend installing locally in every project via `--save-dev`/`--dev`. You can run the Snowpack CLI locally viaÂ package.json "scripts", npm's `npx snowpack`, or via `yarn snowpack`.

## Snowpack's development server

In this step we'll add some files so we can showcase Snowpack's development server, an instant development environment for unbundled development. The development server only builds a file when it's requested by the browser. That means that Snowpack can start up instantly (usually in **<50 ms**) and scale to infinitely large projects without slowing down. In contrast, it's common to see 30+ second dev startup times when building large apps with a traditional bundler.

First create an `index.html` in your project with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="description" content="Starter Snowpack App" />
    <title>Starter Snowpack App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Snowpack!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Add the Snowpack development server to `package.json` under as the `start` script:

```diff
  "scripts": {
+   "start": "snowpack dev",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },

```

Run the following on the command line to start the Snowpack development server

```
npm run start
```

Snowpack displays the local host address and automatically opens the page in your default browser.

IMAGE: GIF. Side by side of the terminal showing the dev server output. The dev server output displays the localhost address the project is running on. In a browser window you can see the running project on localhost, which is "Welcome to Snowpack" on a white background. An edit is made to `index.html` adding an exclamation point, the browser window shows the updated text as soon as the file is saved.

Try changing the index.html and saving while the server is running, the site should refresh and show changes automatically.

## Using ESM (ES Modules)

You're ready to add some ES modules (ESM). JavaScript's native ES Module (ESM) syntax is the magic behind Snowpack's unbundled development. ESM lets you define explicit imports & exports that browsers and build tools can better understand and optimize for. If you're familiar with the `import` and `export` keywords in JavaScript, then you already know ESM!

All modern browsers support ESM, so Snowpack is able to ship this code directly to the browser during development. This is what makes Snowpack's **unbundled development** workflow possible.

Create a JavaScript file called `hello-world.js` that exports a `helloWorld` ES module:

```js
export function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello World!');
}
```

Create an `index.js` that imports your new module using ESM syntax:

```js
import { helloWorld } from './hello-world.js';

helloWorld();
```

Finally, add your `index.js` to `index.html` at the bottom of the `<body>` tag

```diff
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Snowpack!</h1>
+   <script type="module" src="/index.js"></script>
  </body>
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Snowpack detects the files in `index.html` for processing

Check your console on your Snowpack site. You should see "Hello World!" Try making a change to the module. Snowpack will rebuild that module without rebuilding the rest of your code. Snowpack builds **every file individually and caches it indefinitely.** Your development environment will never build a file more than once and your browser will never download a file twice (until it changes). This is the real power of unbundled development.

IMAGE: Gif showing the code next to the project running in the browser. On save the console shows "Hello World!". On edit and save of the `hello-world.js` file to be "Hello everyone!" instead, that instantly shows in the browser console.

## Using npm Packages

While writing your own JavaScript is great, you'll also probably want to use JavaScript from npm. npm packages are mainly published using a module syntax (Common.js, or CJS) that can't run on the web without some build processing. Even if you write your application using browser-native ESM `import` and `export` statements that would all run directly in the browser, trying to import any one npm package will force you back into bundled development.

**Snowpack takes a different approach:** instead of bundling your entire application for this one requirement, Snowpack processes your dependencies separately. Here's how it works:

```
node_modules/react/**/*     -> http://localhost:3000/web_modules/react.js
node_modules/react-dom/**/* -> http://localhost:3000/web_modules/react-dom.js
```

1. Snowpack scans your website/application for all used npm packages.
2. Snowpack reads these installed dependencies from your `node_modules` directory.
3. Snowpack bundles all of your dependencies separately into single JavaScript files. For example: `react` and `react-dom` convert to `react.js` and `react-dom.js`, respectively.
4. Each resulting file runs directly in the browser, and imported via ESM `import` statements.
5. Because your dependencies rarely change, Snowpack rarely needs to rebuild them.

After Snowpack builds your dependencies, any package can be imported and run directly in the browser with zero additional bundling or tooling required. This ability to import npm packages natively in the browser (without a bundler) is the foundation that all unbundled development and the rest of Snowpack builds on top of.

Snowpack lets you import npm packages directly in the browser. Even if a package is using a legacy format, Snowpack will up-convert the package to ESM before serving it to the browser.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: when you start up your development server or run a new build, you may see a message that Snowpack is "installing dependencies." This means that Snowpack is converting your dependencies to run in the browser.

Install the canavas-confetti package from npm and use it with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save canvas-confetti
```

Now head to `index.html` and add this code to the bottom of the `<body>` tag:

```diff
   <script type="module" src="/index.js"></script>
+  <script type="module">
+  import confetti from 'canvas-confetti';
+ confetti.create(document.getElementById('canvas'), {
+  resize: true,
+  useWorker: true,
+ })({ particleCount: 200, spread: 200 });
+  </script>
  </body>
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: you can also add this code in index.js

You should now see a nifty confetti effect on your site.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: not all NPM modules may work well in the browser. If it's dependent on Node.js built-in modules you'll need to polyfill Node. Read more about how to do this on our [features page.](/features)

## Adding CSS

Snowpack natively supports many file types. CSS and CSS Modules for example. Here you'll add a simple CSS file.

First add the following css as a new `index.css` file:

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Include it in your project by adding it to index.html in the `<head>`

```diff
    <meta name="description" content="Starter Snowpack App" />
+   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/index.css" />
    <title>Starter Snowpack App</title>
```

Image: GIF showing adding the css to `index.html` and saving, showing the visual changes as the CSS loads.

## Build for production/deployment

OK you've now built the most amazing website ever (or something like that) and you want to launch it. It's time to use `Snowpack build`.

By default, `snowpack build` builds your site using the same unbundled approach as the `dev` command. Building is tightly integrated with your development setup so that you are guaranteed to get a near-exact copy of the same code that you saw during development.

Add the `snowpack build` comman to package.json so it's easier to run on the command line:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "snowpack dev",
+   "build": "snowpack build",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"

  },

```

Now you can run this in your terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

You should see a new directory called `build` that contains a copy of your Snowpack project ready for deployment.

## Bundle for deployment

`snowpack build` is fine for many projects, but you also may still want to bundle to optimize code, especially with large projects. Snowpack handles legacy browser support, code minification, code-splitting, tree-shaking, dead code elimination, and other performance optimizations via bundling. In this step you'll install the Webpack plugin and use it to build our project.

Snowpack's bundling philosophy is that **you should be able to use a bundler because you want to, and not because you need to.** Snowpack treats bundling as an optional production optimization, which means you're free to skip over the extra complexity of bundling until you need it.

Bundlers normally require dozens or even hundreds of lines of configuration, but with Snowpack it's just a one-line plugin with no configuration required. This is possible because Snowpack builds your application _before_ sending it to the bundler, so the bundler never sees your custom source code (JSX, TS, Svelte, Vue, etc.) and instead only needs to worry about building common HTML, CSS, and JS.

First install the Webpack plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install @snowpack/plugin-webpack --save-dev
```

To tell Snowpack to use it, you'll need to create a configuration file. Create a file named `snowpack.config.js`

```js
// Bundlers plugins are pre-configured to work with Snowpack apps.
// No config required!

module.exports = {
  plugins: ['@snowpack/plugin-webpack'],
};
```

Again run

```bash
npm run build
```

TODO: there is a problem here because it doesn't get the code added in "Using NPM Packages"
