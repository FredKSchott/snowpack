title: JavaScript API
description: Snowpack's JavaScript API is for anyone who wants to integrate with some custom build pipeline or server-side rendering engine.

```js
// JS API Example
import {startServer} from 'snowpack';
const server = await startServer({ ... });
```

Snowpack is most commonly used via the command-line. However, Snowpack also ships a JavaScript API for anyone to integrate with or build on top of.

This documentation is still in progress. However, [Snowpackâ€™s TypeScript type declarations](https://unpkg.com/browse/snowpack@^3.0.0/lib/index.d.ts) give a good summary of the current JS API.
