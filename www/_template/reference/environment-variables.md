title: Environment Variables
description: Using environment variables with Snowpack
---

You can read environment variables directly in your web application via `import.meta.env`. If you've ever used `process.env` in Create React App or any Webpack application, this behaves exactly the same.

For your safety, Snowpack supports only environment variables which begin with `SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_*`. We do this because everything in your web application is sent to the browser, and we don't want you to accidentally share sensitive keys/env variables with your public web application. Prefixing your frontend web env variables with `SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_` is a good reminder that they will be shared with the world.

```js
// `import.meta.env` - Read process.env variables in your web app
fetch(`${import.meta.env.SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_API_URL}/users`).then(...)

// Supports destructuring as well:
const {SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_API_URL} = import.meta.env;
fetch(`${SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_API_URL}/users`).then(...)

// Instead of `import.meta.env.NODE_ENV` use `import.meta.env.MODE`
if (import.meta.env.MODE === 'development') {
  // ...
```


`import.meta.env.MODE` and `import.meta.env.NODE_ENV` are also both set to the current `process.env.NODE_ENV` value, so that you can change app behavior based on dev vs. build. The env value is set to `development` during `snowpack dev` and `production` during `snowpack build`. Use this in your application instead of `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

You can also use environment variables in HTML files. All occurrences of `%SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_*%`, `%PUBLIC_URL%`, and `%MODE%` will be replaced at build time.

**Remember:** that these env variables are statically injected into your application for everyone at **build time**, and not runtime.
