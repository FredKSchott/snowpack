**CLI flags will be merged with (and take priority over) your config file values.** Every config value outlined below can also be passed as a CLI flag. Additionally, Snowpack also supports the following flags:

- **`--config [path]`** Set the path to your project config file.
- **`--help`** Show this help.
- **`--version`** Show the current version.
- **`--reload`** Clear the local cache. Useful for troubleshooting installer issues.
