## Browser Support

**Snowpack builds your site for both modern and legacy browsers. Even IE11 is supported.** You can control and customize this behavior with the ["browserlist" package.json property](https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/).

The only requirement is that _during development_ you use a [modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module). Any recent release of Firefox, Chrome, or Edge will do. This is required to support the modern, bundle-free ESM imports that load your application in the browser.
