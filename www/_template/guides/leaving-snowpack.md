### Leaving Snowpack

Snowpack is designed for zero lock-in. If you ever feel the need to add a traditional application bundler to your stack (for whatever reason!) you can do so in seconds.

Any application built with Snowpack should Just Work™️ when passed through Webpack/Rollup/Parcel. If you are already importing packages by name in your source code (ex: `import React from 'react'`) then you should be able to migrate to any popular bundler without issue.

If you are importing packages by full URL (ex: `import React from '/web_modules/react.js'`), then a simple Find & Replace should help you re-write them to the plain package name imports that most bundlers expect.
