[Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

**To use Sass with Snowpack:** use [@snowpack/plugin-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowpack/plugin-sass).

```diff
// snowpack.config.js
"plugins": [
+  "@snowpack/plugin-sass"
]
```
