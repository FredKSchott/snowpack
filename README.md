<h1>Snowpack</h1>

Snowpack is a modern frontend build tool for faster web development. It replaces heavier, more complex bundlers like webpack or Parcel in your development workflow.

Snowpack leverages JavaScript's native module system (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">known as ESM</a>) to create a first-of-its-kind build system that never builds the same file twice. Snowpack pushes changes instantly to the browser, saving you hours of development time traditionally spent waiting around for your bundler.

### Key Features

- Develop faster, with a dev server that starts up in **50ms or less.**
- See changes reflected [instantly in the browser.](https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/#hot-module-replacement)
- Integrate your favorite bundler for a [production-optimized build.](https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/#snowpack-build)
- Enjoy out-of-the-box support for [TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules and more.](https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/#features)
- Connect your favorite tools with [third-party plugins.](https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/#build-plugins)
