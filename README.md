<h1>Snowpack</h1>

Snowpack is a lightning-fast frontend build tool, designed to leverage JavaScript's native module system (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">known as ESM</a>). It is an alternative to heavier, more complex bundlers like webpack or Parcel in your development workflow.
