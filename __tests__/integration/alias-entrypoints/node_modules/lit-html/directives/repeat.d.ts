/**
 * A directive that repeats a series of values (usually `TemplateResults`)
 * generated from an iterable, and updates those items efficiently when the
 * iterable changes based on user-provided `keys` associated with each item.
 *
 * Note that if a `keyFn` is provided, strict key-to-DOM mapping is maintained,
 * meaning previous DOM for a given key is moved into the new position if
 * needed, and DOM will never be reused with values for different keys (new DOM
 * will always be created for new keys). This is generally the most efficient
 * way to use `repeat` since it performs minimum unnecessary work for insertions
 * amd removals.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If providing a `keyFn`, keys *must* be unique for all items in a
 * given call to `repeat`. The behavior when two or more items have the same key
 * is undefined.
 *
 * If no `keyFn` is provided, this directive will perform similar to mapping
 * items to values, and DOM will be reused against potentially different items.
