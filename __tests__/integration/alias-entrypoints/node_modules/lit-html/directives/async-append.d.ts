/**
 * A directive that renders the items of an async iterable[1], appending new
 * values after previous values, similar to the built-in support for iterables.
 *
 * Async iterables are objects with a [Symbol.asyncIterator] method, which
 * returns an iterator who's `next()` method returns a Promise. When a new
 * value is available, the Promise resolves and the value is appended to the
 * Part controlled by the directive. If another value other than this
 * directive has been set on the Part, the iterable will no longer be listened
 * to and new values won't be written to the Part.
 *

 *
 * @param value An async iterable
 * @param mapper An optional function that maps from (value, index) to another
 *     value. Useful for generating templates for each item in the iterable.
