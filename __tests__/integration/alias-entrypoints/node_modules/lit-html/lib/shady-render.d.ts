/**
 * Extension to the standard `render` method which supports rendering
 * to ShadowRoots when the ShadyDOM (https://github.com/webcomponents/shadydom)
 * and ShadyCSS (https://github.com/webcomponents/shadycss) polyfills are used
 * or when the webcomponentsjs
 * (https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) polyfill is used.
 *
 * Adds a `scopeName` option which is used to scope element DOM and stylesheets
 * when native ShadowDOM is unavailable. The `scopeName` will be added to
 * the class attribute of all rendered DOM. In addition, any style elements will
 * be automatically re-written with this `scopeName` selector and moved out
 * of the rendered DOM and into the document `<head>`.
 *
 * It is common to use this render method in conjunction with a custom element
 * which renders a shadowRoot. When this is done, typically the element's
 * `localName` should be used as the `scopeName`.
 *
 * In addition to DOM scoping, ShadyCSS also supports a basic shim for css
 * custom properties (needed only on older browsers like IE11) and a shim for
 * a deprecated feature called `@apply` that supports applying a set of css
 * custom properties to a given location.
 *
 * Usage considerations:
 *
 * * Part values in `<style>` elements are only applied the first time a given
 * `scopeName` renders. Subsequent changes to parts in style elements will have
 * no effect. Because of this, parts in style elements should only be used for
 * values that will never change, for example parts that set scope-wide theme
 * values or parts which render shared style elements.
 *
 * * Note, due to a limitation of the ShadyDOM polyfill, rendering in a
 * custom element's `constructor` is not supported. Instead rendering should
 * either done asynchronously, for example at microtask timing (for example
 * `Promise.resolve()`), or be deferred until the first time the element's
 * `connectedCallback` runs.
 *
 * Usage considerations when using shimmed custom properties or `@apply`:
 *
 * * Whenever any dynamic changes are made which affect
 * css custom properties, `ShadyCSS.styleElement(element)` must be called
 * to update the element. There are two cases when this is needed:
 * (1) the element is connected to a new parent, (2) a class is added to the
 * element that causes it to match different custom properties.
 * To address the first case when rendering a custom element, `styleElement`
 * should be called in the element's `connectedCallback`.
 *
 * * Shimmed custom properties may only be defined either for an entire
 * shadowRoot (for example, in a `:host` rule) or via a rule that directly
 * matches an element with a shadowRoot. In other words, instead of flowing from
 * parent to child as do native css custom properties, shimmed custom properties
 * flow only from shadowRoots to nested shadowRoots.
 *
 * * When using `@apply` mixing css shorthand property names with
 * non-shorthand names (for example `border` and `border-width`) is not
 * supported.
