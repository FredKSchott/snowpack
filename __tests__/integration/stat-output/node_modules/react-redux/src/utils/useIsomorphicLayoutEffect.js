// React currently throws a warning when using useLayoutEffect on the server.
// To get around it, we can conditionally useEffect on the server (no-op) and
// useLayoutEffect in the browser. We need useLayoutEffect to ensure the store
// subscription callback always has the selector from the latest render commit
// available, otherwise a store update may happen between render and the effect,
// which may cause missed updates; we also must ensure the store subscription
// is created synchronously, otherwise a store update may occur before the
// subscription is created and an inconsistent state may be observed
