// subscription callback always has the selector from the latest render commit
// available, otherwise a store update may happen between render and the effect,
// which may cause missed updates; we also must ensure the store subscription
// is created synchronously, otherwise a store update may occur before the
// subscription is created and an inconsistent state may be observed
