/**
 * Turns an object whose values are action creators, into an object with the
 * same keys, but with every function wrapped into a `dispatch` call so they
 * may be invoked directly. This is just a convenience method, as you can call
 * `store.dispatch(MyActionCreators.doSomething())` yourself just fine.
 *
 * For convenience, you can also pass an action creator as the first argument,
 * and get a dispatch wrapped function in return.
 *
 * @param {Function|Object} actionCreators An object whose values are action
 * creator functions. One handy way to obtain it is to use ES6 `import * as`
 * syntax. You may also pass a single function.
 *
 * @param {Function} dispatch The `dispatch` function available on your Redux
 * store.
 *
 * @returns {Function|Object} The object mimicking the original object, but with
 * every action creator wrapped into the `dispatch` call. If you passed a
 * function as `actionCreators`, the return value will also be a single
 * function.
