# Skypack

This is an experimental SDK for interacting with the Skypack Package CDN. It is not yet ready for publicÂ use, and may change without notice. Use at your own risk!

More documentation will be written as this gets closer to a public release! Until then, you can browse the package code to get a better idea of the interface.

```
npm install skypack
```
