> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Directives

In case you need to add a directive like `classMap` you should add the extension to the import:

```
import { classMap } from "lit-html/directives/class-map.js";
```
