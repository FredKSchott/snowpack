# raf

[![Browser Support](http://ci.testling.com/chrisdickinson/raf.png)](http://ci.testling.com/chrisdickinson/raf)

requestAnimationFrame polyfill for node and the browser.

```js
var raf = require('raf')

raf(function tick() {
  // Animation logic
  raf(tick)
})
```

**Note:** The stream/event emitter logic found in versions prior to 1.0.0 can be found in [raf-stream](https://www.npmjs.org/package/raf-stream).

## Getting started

### CommonJS (Node, Browserify, Webpack, etc.)

Install `raf` from npm:

```bash
npm install --save raf
```

Require it like you would any other module:

```js
const raf = require('raf')
```

### AMD (require.js, etc)

Download the UMD-bundle from [wzrd.in](https://wzrd.in/standalone/raf@latest) (remember to include the current version number in the filename).

Add it to your AMD module loader config and require it like you would any other module:

```html
define(['raf'], raf => {...})
```

### `<script>`

Download the UMD-bundle from [wzrd.in](https://wzrd.in/standalone/raf@latest) (remember to include the current version number in the filename).

Then include it via a script tag:

```html
<script src="raf-x.x.x.js"></script>
```

The API will be available on `window.raf`.

## API

[Documentation at Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame), [W3 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/#requestAnimationFrame)

### var handle = raf(callback)

`callback` is the function to invoke in the next frame. `handle` is a long integer value that uniquely identifies the entry in the callback list. This is a non-zero value, but you may not make any other assumptions about its value.

### raf.cancel(handle)

`handle` is the entry identifier returned by `raf()`. Removes the queued animation frame callback (other queued callbacks will still be invoked unless cancelled).

### raf.polyfill([object])

Shorthand to polyfill `window.requestAnimationFrame` and `window.cancelAnimationFrame` if necessary (Polyfills `global` in node).

Alternatively you can require `raf/polyfill` which will act the same as `require('raf').polyfill()`.

If you provide `object` the polyfills are attached to that given object, instead of the inferred global.
Useful if you have an instance of a fake `window` object, and want to add `raf` and `caf` to it.
